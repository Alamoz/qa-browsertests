    Given that I am on the Portuguese Wikivoyage Main page pt.wikivoyage.org
    When I search for "Africa"
    Then I should be on the Search Results page
      And the page entitled "√Åfrica" should be the top result
      And the results page should show Africa as a red link

  Scenario: Find tokens in the captions of uploaded files
  Given I am on http://commons.wikimedia.beta.wmflabs.org/

    And http://commons.wikimedia.beta.wmflabs.org/wiki/File:Presentation.pdf has the caption "This is a presentation about snails that User:GreenSpark gave on 6 December 2010 in Athens."
